Roma - A transliteration program for Korean text.

Scholars and others working on subjects related to Korea 
often have to render Korean text phonetically with English
letters. There are several accepted schemes for this, but each
is different and requires some knowledge to use properly. In
particular, the McCune-Reischauer system, which is the 
standard method for academic work, requires the use of various
diacritics which are not immediately available on most
contemporary word processors. The purpose of Roma is 
therefore to automate each transliteration scheme.

Roma includes a database of Korean proper names and
other terms with accepted Engish equivalents that do not fit
within any of the standard transliteration schemes. The
database is a simple text file. Additional entries can be
added either through the graphical interface or by
editing the file directly.

Roma can be used both in a terminal and with a GUI.
In text mode, the program can accept Korean text
from standard input but is intended to operate on
files. GUI operation is simple and supports basic
cut and paste operations. Detailed information on
usage can be found in the Roma man page or in the
"Howto" file included in the archive.
